object:

Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), the class syntax provides a clearer and more concise way to create objects and handle 
inheritance. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods. Although the class syntax is more traditional and familiar to developers with an OOP background, it's
 essentially syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.

In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is a unit of code that represents
 a real-world entity and performs specific actions.
 Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP programs

class:

In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template that
 defines the variables and methods of a particular type of object.
 Classes are used to create and manage new objects
