While JavaScript is dynamically-typed, TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, which means it offers 
strict static typing as an option but will allow dynamic typing, as well.As a result, TypeScript code is safer but a 
little trickier to write, resulting in more errors earlier in development.
