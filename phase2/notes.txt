While JavaScript is dynamically-typed, TypeScript is a statically-typed superset 
of JavaScript, which means it offers strict static typing as an option but will 
allow dynamic typing, as well. As a result, TypeScript code is safer but a little
 trickier to write, resulting in more errors earlier in development.


Language Type
JavaScript: A scripting language used for web development.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds extra features.
Typing System
JavaScript: Uses dynamic typing, meaning you donâ€™t need to specify variable types.
TypeScript: Uses static typing, meaning you must define variable types (like string, number, etc.).
Error Checking
JavaScript: Errors appear only when running the code.
TypeScript: Errors appear while writing the code, helping catch mistakes early.
Compilation
JavaScript: Runs directly in the browser or Node.js.
TypeScript: Needs to be compiled (converted) into JavaScript before running.
Features
JavaScript: Basic features for web development.
TypeScript: Adds features like interfaces, classes, and better debugging tools.
Usage
JavaScript: Used by beginners for quick coding.
TypeScript: Used in large projects for better structure and fewer errors.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

so in JavaScript we use npm init to initilize 

so in TypeScript we use tsc --init 

To convert a TypeScript file you need to write the command tsc fileName

----------------------------------------------------------------

"use strict": is use to manage in JavaScript that 

bootcamp = "hello"

To avoid this thing we use "use strict"; in your file add it in your working file at 
the top of the file 


we you are converting js into ts 

npm i --save-dev @types/node

for ignore the errors use // @ts-ignore
