what is components?
A React component is a reusable piece of code that defines a part of a user 
interface. Components are the building blocks of React applications. 

How do React components work?
Structure: Components are written as JavaScript functions. They can contain 
markup (HTML), logic (JS), and styles (CSS). 
Data flow: Components accept inputs called props and return React elements. 
Props are passed from parent to child components. 
Reusability: Components can be reused across different parts of an application.
